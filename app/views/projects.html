        Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
        Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
        when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type
        specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap
        into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.<br>

        Android game application developed for my senior design class that is based on the popular guessing game Battleship. The objective of for this assignment was to create a mobile game that is easy to play for any patient with cerebral palsy. Integrating the ASK Scanning Library, my team and I created an experience that was simple to play for cerebal palsy patients with limited motor ability.<br>
